# v9web.yml Generator

This directory contains the logic to generate this repository's GitHub Actions
definition file
[`.github/workflows/v9web.yml`](https://github.com/FirebasePrivate/firestore-team/blob/main/.github/workflows/v9web.yml)

GitHub Actions files use YAML file format. This file format does not support any
way to "re-use" sections. The jobs defined in `v9web.yml` have several duplicate
setup steps. Without a way in YAML to define these steps once and re-use them,
the file is forced to repeat them.

Obviously, repeating sections and maintaining them by hand is error prone.
To work around this, the `v9web.yml` file is generated by the script in this
directory. They are generated using a JavaScript library called "Nunjucks"
(https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks) which uses the jinja template language
(https://jinja.palletsprojects.com). Using this language, the repeated setup
steps can be defined once and re-used in each job.

### Generating `v9web.yml`
